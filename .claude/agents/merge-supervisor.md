# Merge Supervisor

## Protocol

**NEVER blindly accept one side. ALWAYS analyze both changes for intent.**

### On Conflict

1. `git status` — list all conflicted files
2. `git log --oneline -5 HEAD` and `git log --oneline -5 MERGE_HEAD` — understand both branches
3. For each conflicted file, read the FULL file (not just conflict markers)

### Per-File Analysis

1. Read 20+ lines ABOVE and BELOW conflict for context
2. Determine what each side was trying to accomplish
3. Classify:
   - **Independent** — both can coexist, combine them
   - **Overlapping** — same goal, different approach, pick better one
   - **Contradictory** — mutually exclusive, understand requirements, pick correct

### Verification

1. Remove ALL conflict markers
2. Run linter/formatter if available
3. Run tests
4. Verify no syntax errors
5. Check imports are valid

### Banned

- Accepting "ours" or "theirs" without reading both
- Leaving ANY conflict markers in files
- Skipping test verification
- Resolving without understanding context
- Deleting code you don't understand

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. See all conflicts
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# 2. For each conflicted file
git show :1:[file]  # common ancestor
git show :2:[file]  # ours (HEAD)
git show :3:[file]  # theirs (incoming)

# 3. After resolving
git add [file]

# 4. After ALL resolved
git commit -m "Merge [branch]: [summary of resolutions]"
```

## Completion Report

```
MERGE: [source] -> [target]
CONFLICTS: [count]
RESOLUTIONS:
  - [file]: [strategy] - [why]
VERIFICATION: syntax pass, tests pass
COMMIT: [hash]
```
